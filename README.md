# SleepTrackingApp for better night

<h1>Introduction:</h1>
The Sleep Tracking Application is designed to help users track their sleep patterns and improve their overall sleep quality. The application will allow users to record the duration and quality of their sleep, track their sleep patterns over time, and receive personalized recommendations to improve their sleep habits. The application will be developed using Java/Kotlin programming language.

<h1>Objective:</h1>
The objective of this project is to design and develop a sleep tracking application that will allow users to track their sleep patterns and receive personalized recommendations to improve their sleep quality.

<h1>Features:</h1>

The following are the key features of the Sleep Tracking Application:

<ol>
<li>Sleep Tracking: The application will allow users to record the duration and quality of their sleep.</li>
<br>
<li>Sleep Patterns: The application will track users’ sleep patterns over time and provide insights into their sleep habits.</li>
<br>
<li>Personalized Recommendations: The application will provide users with personalized recommendations to improve their sleep habits based on their sleep patterns.</li> 
<br>
<li>User Profile: The application will allow users to create and manage their profiles, which will include their sleep history and personalized recommendations.</li>
<br>
<li>Notification System: The application will have a notification system that will remind users to go to bed and wake up at a consistent time.</li>
<br>
<li>Data Visualization: The application will provide users with a visual representation of their sleep patterns and progress over time.</li>
	</ol>

<h1>Technologies:</h1>

The following technologies will be used to develop the Sleep Tracking Application:

<ul>
<li>Java/Kotlin: The primary programming languages for the development of the application.</li>
<br>
<li>Android Studio: The integrated development environment for Android app development.</li>
<br>
<li>SQLite: The relational database management system for storing user data.</li>
<br>
<li>Retrofit: The REST API client for retrieving data from external APIs.</li>
<br>
<li>MPAndroidChart: The library for visualizing data in the form of charts and graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Development Process:</h1>

The development of the Sleep Tracking Application will follow the following process:
<ul>
<li>Requirements Gathering: This phase involves gathering and analyzing user requirements and documenting them in a detailed requirements specification document.</li>
<br>
<li>Design: In this phase, the application's architecture, user interface, and database schema will be designed.</li>
<br>
<li>Development: The actual coding of the application will take place in this phase, using Java/Kotlin programming language.</li>
<br>
<li>Testing: The application will be tested for bugs, errors, and usability issues to ensure that it meets the requirements specification document.</li>
<br>
<li>Deployment: Once the application is tested and approved, it will be deployed on the Google Play Store.</li>
	</ul>

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
The Sleep Tracking Application is an essential tool that will help users track their sleep patterns and improve their overall sleep quality. The application will be developed using Java/Kotlin programming language, Android Studio, SQLite, Retrofit, and MPAndroidChart libraries. The development process will follow the requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment phases.
